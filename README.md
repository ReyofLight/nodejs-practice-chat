"# nodejs-practice-chat" 

I don't know why it's so hard for me to learn git, in my own defense I was taught by 0 people so far. 
I don't know how to write very good documentation either, so here goes. 

This is a "chat" server which runs locally on your machine (current port is 3700) which uses Express Node.js, Pug template engine, and Socket.io. Basically you should be able to talk to yourself using multiple web browsers on the same port. 



To use this useless thing:
1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Casually ignore any files in \tpl that aren't 'page.pug'
3. Download or copy files into an enclosing directory
4. Use command line to navigate to the location of that directory
5. run "npm install" in that directory to get proper node-modules

To run chat server: 
node index.js

response should be "listening on port 3700"
